Moved from GitHub to other git forges, disagreeing with the direction GitHub has taken for many years now. Octocat deserves better.

I do hope the self hostable git forges start looking into community features, possibly fediverse inspired, like e.g. GitHub has, such as being able to: 
- Cross forge search!! Ie. there are search indexes, themselves self hostable, that the self hosted forges may opt to connect to. Through them you can search for content on other instances, as if they are on your own instance!
- Star repos on remote instances
- Follow people across instances
- Fork each others projects easily and such
- Get updates from other users (new repos etc.)
- Maybe even sign into each other's instances or otherwise be able to interact/contribute without creating a user there (I guess openid could possibly fill that role)

...and somethings gists-like woul be nice.
