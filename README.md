Moved from GitHub to other git forges, disagreeing with the direction GitHub has taken for many years now. Octocat deserves better.

I do hope the self hostable git forges start looking into community features, possibly fediverse inspired, like e.g. GitHub has, such as being able to: 
- Star repos on remote instances
- Follow people across instances
- Fork each others projects easily and such
- Get updates from other users (new repos etc.)
- Maybe even sign into each other's instances or otherwise be able to interact/contribute without creating a user there (I guess openid could possibly fill that role)

...and somethings gists-like woul be nice.
